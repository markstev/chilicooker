Goal:
 - software controlled heating elements to increase temp to a target and hold it
   there.
 - a user should be able to run a command on linux/mac while connected and update
   the target temperature.

Architecture:
1) arduino PWM based on distance from target temperature
2) serial communication from a laptop
